### Deep learning intravoxel incoherent motion modelling: Exploring the impact of training features and learning strategies
This repository contains the code regarding the publication: 'Deep learning intravoxel incoherent motion modelling: Exploring the impact of training features and learning strategies'. In this work, we have explored potential impacts of key training features in unsupervised and supervised learning for IVIM model fitting. The code contains our unsupervised and supervised networks when trained on the uniform distribution synthetic data set. 

## For easy start, run the code 'Explore_Deep_Learning_IVIM_code.py'

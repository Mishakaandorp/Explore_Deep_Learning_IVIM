### Deep learning intravoxel incoherent motion modelling: Exploring the impact of training features and learning strategies
Currently, our manuscript 'Deep learning intravoxel incoherent motion modelling: Exploring the impact of training features and learning strategies' is under review, and has minor revisions.
We will publish the code for our unsupervised and supervised networks, trained on the uniform distribution synthetic data set, after publication
of the present manuscript
